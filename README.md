# Stardew Valley BotFramework

This mod doesn't do anything on its own, however it offers developers a Framework to create bots to complete automated tasks.

#### Developers, this framework is for you if you:

Want a `Stardew.Character` to perform `Actions` on `Targets` (Tile, Objects or Characters) in one or multiple `GameLocations`.

#### The bot framework handles:

- What route to most efficiently go through GameLocations.
- The order of targets to most efficiently visit them all.
- Executing your action on the targets.

The BotFramework utilizes a variety of path and route finding algorithms to give you a fully functioning bot!
