# Stardew Valley BotFramework

# When To Use

Developers, this framework is for you if you want:

A `Stardew.Character` to perform `Actions` on `Targets` (Tile, Objects or Characters) in one or multiple `GameLocations`.

# Features

- Determines best route through GameLocations.
- Determines best order to visit targets to get through them as efficiently as possible.
- Executes your action on the targets.

The BotFramework utilizes a variety of path and route finding algorithms to give you a fully functioning bot!
